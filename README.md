## About

S2UK SteamVR Controller is a proof-of-concept 6-DOF SteamVR system that turns Android phones into fully tracked VR controllers.

It was made using Kinect v1 (Xbox 360) hardware with Microsoft's NuiApi for head/hand positional tracking.

**Note:** Positional tracking is limited to approximately 180° in front of the sensor.

The Android app **emulates** Meta Touch Plus controllers (from Meta Quest 3/3S), providing a low-cost alternative for users who want to experiment with VR or quickly test applications without a full VR setup.


**Project architecture:**
- **Windows SteamVR driver** – Fully-written in C++ -- communicates with the connected Android device via TCP and interfaces with the Kinect sensor and OpenVR.
- **Android companion app** – Built with Java/Kotlin/C++ -- sends orientation and input data to the PC and receives haptic feedback over the local network.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C++20, Java, Kotlin
- **Libraries:** OpenVR, NuiApi, MinHook
- **Build Tools:** MSVC, Gradle, CMake
- **Hardware:** SteamVR-compatible HMD (or emulated), Kinect v1 (Xbox 360 Kinect), Android phones

---

## Prerequisites

- **C++20-compatible compiler:**
  - MSVC 17.x (Visual Studio 2022)
- **Android Studio** (latest stable)
- **CMake** ≥ 3.22.1 (bundled with Android Studio)  
- **Android NDK** (installed via Android Studio SDK Manager)
- **Gradle** (bundled with Android Studio)
- **Kinect for Windows SDK v1.8** – [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278)
- **Minimum Android API (minSdkVersion):** `31` (Android 12)

---

## Installation

1. **Install SteamVR**
   - Available via Steam: [SteamVR Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/)
2. **Install Kinect SDK v1.8**
   - Download here: [Kinect for Windows SDK v1.8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278)
3. **Get the latest release**
   - Download the **SteamVR driver** and **Android APK** from the [Releases](https://github.com/s2ukDev/SteamVRController/releases) tab
   - Or compile both from source
4. **Install the SteamVR driver**
   - Unzip the driver into:
     ```
     <Steam installation directory>\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\
     ```

---

## Build & Run

Before building, make sure you have installed all prerequisites: SteamVR, Kinect SDK v1.8, and the Android SDK/NDK.

1. **Clone the repo**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/s2ukDev/SteamVRController.git
```

2. **Build the Windows SteamVR driver**
   1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022:
     * SteamVRController\SteamVR-Windows-Driver\s2uk_controller\s2uk_controller.sln
   2. Modify the post-build script if needed:
     * SteamVRController\SteamVR-Windows-Driver\s2uk_controller\postBuildScript.bat
  3. **Build the project in Release mode.**
3. **Build the Android app**
   1. Open Android Studio.
   2. Open the project located at: SteamVRController\Android\S2UK_VRController
   3. Ensure the Android NDK is installed via the SDK Manager.
   4. Build the APK in Android Studio UI or via terminal:
      ```bat
      gradlew assembleRelease
      ```
   5. Make sure your phone API version is supported.
   5. Install the APK on your Android devices.

## Post-build

  1. The post-build script will copy the driver for you automatically.  
   - Confirm the driver exists at:
     
     `<Steam installation directory>\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\s2ukController\`
     
   - If not, modify `<repositoryDir>SteamVRController\SteamVR-Windows-Driver\s2uk_controller\postBuildScript.bat` to point to your Steam installation directory and re-run the build.
  2. Connect your Kinect v1 sensor and verify the Kinect SDK v1.8 is working properly.
  3. Start **SteamVR**.
  4. In SteamVR go to **Settings → Drivers** and enable **s2ukController** (toggle the driver on).
  5. Launch the Android app on your phones and enter the Steam VR PC's local IP address.  
   - **Controllers should start receiving orientation updates and positional data from the Kinect.**

---

## Troubleshooting

- Restart SteamVR and verify the driver folder exists:  
  `<Steam installation directory>\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\s2ukController\`
- Check the post-build script for errors, copy the driver manually.
- Use Android Studio **Logcat** (or `adb logcat`) to debug the APK → PC connection.
- Ensure the PC and phone are on the **same local network** and same subnet.
- Check for firewall settings and open/forward the required LAN port (`TCP 9775`).
- If problems persist, reboot the PC and the phone and try again.

**If none of the above help, submit a github issue describing your problem.**

## Configuration

Driver configuration is stored as JSON at:

`<Steam installation directory>\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\s2ukController\driver_config.json`

**Note:**  
- The configuration file will be **automatically generated** if it does not exist or contains corrupted syntax.  
- Changes to the config are applied when the headset **exits standby** or during **SteamVR driver initialization**.

### Example `driver_config.json`
```json
{
  "headEMA": 0.3,
  "leftHandEMA": 0.3,
  "rightHandEMA": 0.3,
  "sensorTilt": 0
}
```
**Fields and Types**

- **headEMA** — *double* (0.0 -- 1.0)  
  Exponential moving average weight for head positional smoothing.  
  Lower = smoother (more interpolation), higher = more responsive.  
  **Default:** `0.3`

- **leftHandEMA** — *double* (0.0 -- 1.0)  
  EMA weight for left controller smoothing.  
  **Default:** `0.3`

- **rightHandEMA** — *double* (0.0 -- 1.0)  
  EMA weight for right controller smoothing.  
  **Default:** `0.3`

- **sensorTilt** — *integer* (degrees, clamped to -27 -- +27)  
  Tilt angle applied to Kinect sensor. 
  **Default:** `0`

## Screenshots & Videos
*Screenshots and demo videos will be added to show controller & HMD tracking in SteamVR Home, Beat Saber, The Lab and VRChat.*
